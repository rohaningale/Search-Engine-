# Search-Engine-
Developed a search engine using Hadoop Map-Reduce framework, to return the top 10 documents containing the given search keyword. 
The input documents are loaded into HBase table built on top the HDFS for faster retrieval of data. 
An inverted index is built on the data stored in HBase table to support efficient search. 
Implemented a page rank algorithm to determine the top 10 documents relevant to given search keyword.
